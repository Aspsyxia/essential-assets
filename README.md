## Essential Assets

A work in progress project that contains all basic assets that I often re-use in game projects I work on. You will find there a ready to go
player controllers for both FPS and TPP perspectives, interaction system, passages with key system, dialogue system and more.

All of them are created by me, but I often used some internet tutorials, so I think it's only fair if I make it public.

### To do

- I need to figure out better project structure for more "drag and drop" usage
- I'm still learning, so there's plenty of refactoring to do in terms of dependencies
- More reliable TPP controller
- Inventory system
- Weapon system

## Essential Assets

This work-in-progress project comprises essential assets I frequently use in my game projects, adventure games for the most part. It includes player controllers for first-person perspective games, a sample menu featuring settings, as well as interaction, dialogue, and inventory systems, among other functionalities.

All of them are created by me, but I often used some internet tutorials, so I think it's only fair if I make it public.

### To do

- More refactoring to do in terms of dependencies
- More reliable TPP controller
- Brightness settings
- More modular inventory system as well as ability to equip items from inventory screen, not only view them
- Removing objects from inventory
- Implement design patterns for player controller and other elements

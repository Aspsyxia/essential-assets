## Essential Assets

A work in progress project that contains all basic assets that I often re-use in game projects I work on. You will find there a ready to go
player controllers for FPS games, sample menu with settings, interaction, dialogue and inventory systems and more.

All of them are created by me, but I often used some internet tutorials, so I think it's only fair if I make it public.

### To do

- Project structure for more "drag and drop" usage
- Refactoring to do in terms of dependencies
- More reliable TPP controller
- Brightness setting
- More modular inventory system as well as ability to equip items from inventory screen, not only view them
